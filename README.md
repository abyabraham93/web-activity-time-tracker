# Web Activity Time Tracker - Enhanced Fork

## üîç About This Fork

This is an enhanced fork of the original [Web Activity Time Tracker](https://github.com/Stigmatoz/web-activity-time-tracker/) by [Stigmatoz](https://github.com/Stigmatoz). All credit for the original extension goes to the original author.


This extension tracks your web time and shows you the cold, hard truth about your browsing habits. Set daily limits and get blocked when you've wasted enough time.

Your data stays on YOUR device. We use local [chrome.storage API](https://developer.chrome.com/apps/storage) only - no cloud uploads, no tracking, no judgment (well, maybe a little).

You can see your daily stats.

And you can see your overall stats.
